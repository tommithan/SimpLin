# myPackage

`SimpLin` is an R package I made for my first STAT 600 assignment. It is used to fit a simple linear regression model.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `SimpLin` from GitHub with:

```r
devtools::install_github("tommithan/SimpLin")
```
If you do not have `devtools` installed, you will need to install it before running this code.
