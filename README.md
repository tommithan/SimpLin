# myPackage

`SimpLin` is an R package I made for my first STAT 600 assignment. It is used to fit a simple linear regression model.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `SimpLin` from GitHub with:

```r
devtools::install_github("tommithan/SimpLin", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
If you do not have `devtools` installed, you will need to install it before running this code. 

You can also download `SimpLin_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz` available in the repository and run: 

```r
devtools::install_local("SimpLin_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
When running this line, make sure `SimpLin_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz` is in your working directory.
